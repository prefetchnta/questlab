### Coding Styles

Coding style, or programming style, is a set of rules or guidelines 
used when writing the source code. It is often claimed that following 
a particular coding style will help in reading and understanding 
source code conforming to the style, and help to avoid introducing 
errors.

### .ini Files

The .ini files in this folder contain 
Artistic Style options for various coding styles. Using the option 
files will give approximately the indicated coding style. The
files may be input using --options=filepath/filename.ini.


### .yaml Files

The .yaml files in this folder are clang-format style configuration  
files. They have been modified to have approximately the same options as
the Artistic Style options files. Change the file name to.clang-format 
or _clang-format to use the files. The results can be compared to 
the Artistic style results using the above .ini files.
