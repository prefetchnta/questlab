INSTALLATION:
-------------
    -place these files and folders into Notepad++'s "plugins" folder
    -BUT (!!!) if you installed N++ with "Don't use %APPDATA%" UNCHECKED,
     then place the "Config" folder into "%APPDATA%\Notepad++\plugins" instead!
    -check out the help text ("Help & About")
    -enjoy

CHANGES:
-------------
    0.7.3
       -fix: unicode functionality broken in N++
    0.7.2
       -fix: CTags: regex handling is broken for some languages (PHP,..)
    0.7.1
       -new: option "Go to definition by pressing ctrl + left mousebutton"
       -new: option "Max. number of symbols to show" (It's recommended to limit the count of
              symbols which are shown as nodes in the treeview, in order to prevent a hanging N++
              when for instance source files with several thousand symbols are analyzed.
              When in cookie session mode, then such files are automatically loaded into the
              INCLUDES folder. In the other modes the symbols of such files aren't loaded at all.)
       -new: option "Show plus minus controls (for source nodes)"
       -fix: CTags: lots of fixes in the CParser (C, C++, C#, Java,..)
       -fix: allow loading of session files created by older versions
       -fix: in N++ session mode: file nodes vanishing when moving a file from one N++ view to another
    0.7
       -IMPORTANT: the plugin will be C#-only from now on, thus no more use of C++ loader/wrapper DLLs.
                   advantage: much faster startup time. disadvantage: no more warning message about
                   missing .NET runtime (unknown plugin loading error instead).
       -IMPORTANT: sorry, but again .c00k!e session files of previous versions are invalid for this new version!
       -new: CTags: update sources (fixes for C and OCaml + support for Objective-C)
       -new: CTags: add support for CSS (ctags patch by Iago Rubio)
       -new: CTags: add support for INFORMIX 4GL (ctags extension by Tim Kim)
       -new: add regex rules for Autohotkey (AHK) (thanks to vixay)
       -new: "Import" and "Export" settings of one or more languages (in language settings dialog)
       -new: treenode contextmenu items: "Collapse all", "Expand all"
       -new: new option "Size limit of analyzed INCLUDES"
       -new: new option "Session file extension" (default = "c00k!e")
       -new: new option "Use relative paths in session file"
       -new: new option "Handle CTags warnings as errors" (helpful when trying out new regex entries)
       -new: new option "Show plus minus controls (for tag nodes)"
       -new: show tooltips in options dialog
       -new: buttons "Select All" and "Select None" in import dialog (after drag&drop of multiple extension types)
       -new: provide auto restore of corrupted language settings file
       -new: support message+filepath from other plugins in order to add files to a session
       -fix: CTags: PythonParser: wrong parent nesting in PythonParser
       -fix: CTags: PythonParser: enable function arguments
       -fix: CTags: C#Parser: fully disable local variables tag to avoid false tags
       -fix: context menu not shown when tag type node is selected (in grouped view)
       -fix: in Cookie session mode: unexpected N++ behavior when SourceCookifier panel titel is longer than 32 chars
       -fix: in N++ session mode: sourcelist doesn't get updated when treeview is invisible
       -fix: when plugin's startup mode is 'hide', then the plugin might show up only after 2nd try
       -fix: exceptions/deadlocks when switching view mode, sorting, etc. with multiple source nodes in treeview
       -fix: wrong node nesting in class view mode
       -fix: when searching (search textbox) in class view mode, then not all nodes are expanded
       -fix: characters ' ' (space) and '!' are not allowed in regex expressions
       -fix: exception on "Go To Definition" when using "Includes" files
       -fix: exception when opening contextmenu on 'unsupported source type' nodes
    0.6.1
       -new: CTRL+C copies currently selected treeview item (tag name) to clipboard
       -fix: parsing of source files with UTF-16 format and windows-like EOL (CR + LF)
       -fix: prevent CTags from unintentionally finding config files in the PATH and using them
             (may lead to unexpected behavior)
       -fix: exceptions when adding/changing source node files when both the treeview contains
             'invalid' source nodes and the search filter is in use
       -fix: editor didn't get focused when mouse middle button clicking on treeview items
       -changed: removed option "Use 'tags' file instead of StandardOut" - now always reading from tags file.
             Using StandardOut was even slower anyway due to CTags always writing into a temp tags file.
             Also the location of the tags file changed to the plugins config folder.
    0.6
       -IMPORTANT: sorry, but .c00k!e session files of previous versions might be invalid for this new version !
       -new: CLASS VIEW (single file scope) for object oriented languages.
             (Multiple file scoped view is still in progress, but it might never get finished, since it seems
             undoable at the moment)
       -new: [display] return type of functions
             (as new extended field type. merged from ctags mods of Anjuta DevStudio sources.
             at the moment only works for C-like languages (C/C++/C#/Java) out of the box)

       -new: enable (in CTAGS) 'Mac OS 9' form for source code parser (EOL = CR)
       -fix: bring import dialog to top
       -fix: crash when tab window is initialized in 'N++ session mode'

    0.5.3
       -new: show session mode/name in toolbar caption 
       -fix: 1252 as default encoding for streams and stdout (since v0.5 SourceCookifier didn't work

        might have failed due to missing admin rights in previous versions; also into one and
        the same file (appending) now instead of 1 file per error
    0.5
       -native loader for plugin wrapper: .NET runtime doesn't get loaded until you start
        using the plug-in, so that N++ usually starts like a rocket again
       -messagebox to notify about missing .NET runtime, when you try to use the plug-in
        without installed .NET 2.0
       -progress bar inside of treeview (when adding/refreshing multiple sources/includefiles)

       -changed toggling behavior: focus treeview if visible and not focused - hide if visible and focused
       -'Basic' icons and settings

KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------
    -GDI glitches:    sometimes the treeview doesn't get correctly redrawn (refreshed)
    -N++ shortcuts:   when the sourcecookifier toolbar does NOT use flowing buttons,
                      then all of N++'s shortcuts suddenly don't work anymore as soon
                      as you move the mouse pointer from its overflow menu (>>) directly
                      back into the sourcecookifier toolbar. you can restore the
                      functionality of all shortcuts simply by opening the overflow menu
                      again and this time pressing a button or leaving the menu somewhere
                      else (not directly into the toolbar)... weird bug and out of my
                      grasp!!!
    -Floating window: When the windows is not docked to a border but in floating state, then
                      do NOT change the focus from the SourceCookifier search textbox
                      directly back to the N++ editor window. N++ will deadlock at once!
                      Better don't use SourceCookifier in floating state at the moment.
                      For some reason sub windows don't receive WM_KILLFOCUS messages and
                      alike when loosing focus to a 'native' window above.
